# Wikipedia Binge Visualizer

Intended to let you view a Wikipedia binge session as a tree, based on the implicit tree structured created by opening links in new tabs.

This project is not finished. I started it about a year ago but other tasks came up. I might get back to it one day.

To see what's currently working, you can run `npm i` followed by `npm start`. Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/
